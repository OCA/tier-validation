        mirror Odoo's activity systray layout:

        - ``late_count`` -- pending reviews older than the configured
          *late* threshold (``base_tier_validation.late_after_days``,
          default ``7``). The reviewer should prioritise these.
        - ``pending_count`` -- pending reviews within the threshold.
          Standard work the reviewer can act on today.
        - ``future_count`` -- waiting reviews where the current user is
          assigned as reviewer but the sequence has not yet promoted the
          review to pending. "What is incoming for me".

        The per-bucket record ids are returned alongside the counts so
        clicking a bucket in the systray opens exactly those records.
